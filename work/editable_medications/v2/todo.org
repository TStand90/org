#+title: Editable Medications V2 - TODO

[[https://www.figma.com/design/8fpr75UqvO70UFUuM7zvS7/Pending-Orders?node-id=1-2&node-type=canvas&t=14jfXwqdT3PBqYZr-0][Alka's Figma UI Mockup]]

* Investigations, Estimations, and Spikes
** [ ] Make estimations for Editable Meds V2 UI
*** [ ] Estimation for the UI using Jinja templates
**** [ ] Backend
***** [ ] API endpoint for the proposed carts (displayed as "pending orders")
- Note taken on [2024-12-10 Tue 11:03] \\
  We can probably use the ProposedCart API V3 endpoint that already exists. This endpoint currenly only has a POST action, for creating the ProposedCart.
***** [ ] Rewrite the current accept/deny actions to refresh the page instead of redirect to the patient dashboard home page
**** [ ] Frontend
***** [ ] Create table to display the proposed cart
***** [ ] Create "loading" indicator and overlay for when the proposed cart is processing.
- Note taken on [2024-12-10 Tue 11:07] \\
  Apparently Bootstrap 4 does not have a built-in component for this.
***** [ ] Optional: Refactor existing Orders table, use the same Flask component for both ProposedCart and Orders
- Note taken on [2024-12-10 Tue 11:12] \\
  May not be possile. The UI mockup has different fields than the existing table.
*** NO Estimation for the UI using React
Don't think this is a good idea. Won't explore this unless someone says we need to do it.

Need this because WISPENG-979 needs to query multiple packages. This is better than querying in a for loop.
