** What needs upgrading
According to GPT 4o, here's what's holding us back:

*** flask-login
Currently held back at "<0.6.0"
Installed: 0.5.0
Current version: 0.7.0

*** markupsafe
Currently held back at "<=2.0.1"
Installed: 2.0.1
Current version: 3.0.2

(May be because of WTForms?)

**** Looks like Jinja2 needs to be upgraded before this can be (or maybe at the same time).

*** wtforms
Currently held back at "<3.*"
Installed: 2.3.3
Current version: 3.2.1

**** WTForms 3.1 has a dependency on MarkupSafe. Not sure which version.

*** graphene
Currently held back at "<3.*"
Installed: 2.1.9
Current version: 3.4.3

** Flask 2.1 upgrade considerations
*** ~jsonfiy~ now throws an error for non-dict objects. Find all uses of ~jsonify~ and ensure they are taking dicts.
- Note: Do Pydantic objects work? Because apparently we are doing that a fair bit with some DoseSpot stuff.

It looks like we need at least version 4.5.3, that release mentions support for Flask 3.0

* Mypy errors when upgrading
These errors occur when upgrading the packages. Is mypy getting upgraded as well?

mypy...
app/controllers/api/v3/legacy_base_schemas.py:25: error: Function is missing a return type annotation  [no-untyped-def]
app/controllers/api/v3/base_schemas.py:25: error: Function is missing a return type annotation  [no-untyped-def]
app/models/subscription.py:1157: error: Item "None" of "Optional[Any]" has no attribute "custom_discount"  [union-attr]
app/models/subscription.py:1161: error: Item "None" of "Optional[Any]" has no attribute "activate"  [union-attr]

* Flask changes
** dispatch_request changes
The method ~MethodView.dispatch_request~ has changed. It used to accept ~*args~, but now only accepts ~**kwargs~. We use ~*args~ in a few spots.

Theoretically, passing whatever args as a keyword argument instead should solve these issues. It's also possible that the args were never used in the first place, as apparently, even Flask 1.1 did not use ~*args~, only ~**kwargs~.

* Python version
Flask 3.1 supports 3.9 as its _minimum version_. After this migration is complete, we should strongly consider upgrading our Python installation to the latest version. If we do not, we risk falling behind again in the near future.

** PR description
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Pasting the text here because I will have to copy-paste this _a lot_
:END:
[WISPENG-1259](https://hellowisp.atlassian.net/browse/WISPENG-1259)

## Description
Please see https://hellowisp.atlassian.net/browse/WISPENG-1255 for a description on why this is necessary.

## Added/updated tests?
- [ ] Yes
- [x] No, and this is why: It will take too much time to write tests for each and every one of these. Functionality should be unchanged.
- [ ] I need help with writing tests

## Related Tickets and/or Pull Requests
https://hellowisp.atlassian.net/browse/WISPENG-1255

* Tasks
** [ ] Make a PR for the "token" tests.
I moved/updated tests as part of [[https://github.com/hellowisp/secure.hellowisp.com/pull/5607][WISPENG-1377]], but the tests could be updated independently.

That PR is huge as-is, so moving it might make sense.

Then again, the way expirations were handled has changed, so not all the changes can be made independently. Maybe it's not worth it?
** [ ] Add the new env vars from WISPENG-1377 to the PR
I'm not adding them to the config file now, because that could make rebasing a pain in the ass. But I should do it before merging.
