* Upgrade Flask!
Un-pinning upgraded to Flask 2.1.3 rather than 3.1.0, certain libraries must be holding it back.

* [ ] Investigate upgrading Alembic to the latest version
* [ ] Investigate upgrading SQLAlchemy to the latest version
* [-] Investigate upgrading flask-login to the latest version
- Note taken on [2025-03-03 Mon 16:08] \\
  Asked dev-private if anyone knows why it's pinned, waiting for response.
Un-pinning flask-login bumped it to 0.6.3, the latest version

- flask-login 0.6.3 should support as low as Flask 1.0.4 and Werkzeug 1.0.1, so that should not be holding us back.
  (We are on Flask 1.1.4 and Werkzeug 1.0.1)
  - Tried installing 0.6.3 and it seems to work fine?

* [ ] Investigate upgrading graphene to the latest version
* [ ] Investigate upgrading wtforms to the latest version
* [ ] Investigate upgrading markupsafe to the latest version

* [ ] Remove flask-script from pipfile
