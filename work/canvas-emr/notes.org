* Separating DoseSpot from the Rx model
Joey has proposed that we add columns and gradually remove the ~dosespot_rx~ field.

We could introduce fields to store data from Canvas, such as ~refills~, ~prescription_id~, and ~prescriber_id~. We could have the ORM wrap these fields in properties, similar to how ~dosespot_rx~ wraps the field ~_dosespot_rx~, to control reads and writes.

That would allow us to "read" something like ~refills~ like this:
1. Check if the ~refills~ column has data. If so, return that.
2. If we are using Canvas, return nothing, as we don't have data. (Or maybe fetch from Canvas if that's possible)
3. If we are using DoseSpot, and if ~refills~ is empty, check ~dosespot_rx~.
4. If that is empty, get the metadata (this happens automatically as part of reading ~dosespot_rx~).


* Things to do
** [ ] Create database migration for each column we need
*** [ ] erx_pharmacy_id

  This one doesn't appear to be used either.
*** [ ] erx_prescriber_id
- Note taken on [2025-04-04 Fri 14:13] \\
  No need to do this one, we can remove it since it's not used.
*** [ ] erx_prescription_id
*** [ ] erx_refills
