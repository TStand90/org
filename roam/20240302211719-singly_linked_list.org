#+title: Singly Linked List
#+filetags: :Data_Structures:

A singly [[id:d0b02bbc-6d2e-4905-aba3-a3cbe3e97b20][Linked List]] is similar to an [[id:721cecef-36a5-4fe7-9cf0-b885d92dc690][Array]] in that it stores contiguous data. Instead of storing the data in an allocated memory block, it stores things as several nodes, each with a value and a pointer to the next node.

Linked lists are not stored in a contiguous memory block. You cannot control where in memory each node is allocated.

Linked Lists that store a pointer to the previous node also are known as [[id:4a9cdda1-5551-43e4-8c1d-51dece219cdc][Doubly Linked List]]s.

#+NAME: Python Singly Linked List Node class
#+BEGIN_SRC python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None
#+END_SRC

Traversing the linked list might look something like this:

#+NAME: Traversing a singly linked list in Python
#+BEGIN_SRC python
cur = ListNode1
while cur:
    cur = cur.next
#+END_SRC
