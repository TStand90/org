#+title: pytest

~pytest~ is the most popular testing libary for [[id:3a948b50-dedc-4fdf-a86c-05c1c3a9f230][Python]].

* Tips and Tricks
** Asserting that an exception was raised.
You can assert that an exception is raised in code with ~pytest.raises~. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
with pytest.raises(ValueError):
    int("This won't work!")
#+END_SRC

This will succeed if the exception is raised, and fail if it doesn't.

*** Asserting the exception message
It's also possible to assert the exception message, using the ~match~ argument for ~pytest.raises~.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
with pytest.raises(ValueError, match='invalid literal for int() with base 10: "This won\'t work!"'):
    int("This won't work!")
#+END_SRC
