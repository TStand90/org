#+title: Getters and Setters

Getters and Setters are a concept in [[id:0cabecd4-2482-413f-a76a-81ad31b6bd2b][Object Oriented Programming]] which allows encapsulation of fields.

Here are some advantages of using this getters and setters:
- They encapsulate behavior associated with getting or setting a field. Examples include validating the field, or returning a computed value.
- They hide internal representation.
- They allow easier debugging by setting a breakpoint or log inside the getter or setter function, so you can debug when a field is accessed or altered easily.
