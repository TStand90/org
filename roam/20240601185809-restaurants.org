A list of restaurants and our feelings about them.

* Phoenician Mediterranean Grill
Don't order again. It made Pooja and Marcus sick after eating the salmon.

* Tandoori Pizza
Good overall

** Potato Pizza
Good!

** Achari Wings
"Authentic", but not as good as Curry Pizza wings

** Tandoori Wings
Not bad, but also not as good as Curry Pizza's wings

** Mango Lassi
Aurora likes it. I think it's alright. Pooja did not like it that much.
