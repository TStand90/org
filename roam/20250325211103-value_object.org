#+title: Value Object

A Value Object is an object that is uniquely identified by the data it holds. They are usually immutable.

For example, in [[id:3a948b50-dedc-4fdf-a86c-05c1c3a9f230][Python]], dataclasses are Value Objects. They can be made immutable with the ~frozen~ parameter.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class StreetAddress:
    """Represents a street address."""

    street: str
    city: str
