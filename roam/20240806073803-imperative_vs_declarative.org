#+title: Imperative vs. Declarative

Imperative and Declarative are two different programming styles.

* Imperative
** Imperative works with individual statements that advance the program state.
** Uses independent function calls
** Often uses mutable objects

* Declarative
** Uses expressions that build upon each other to progress the flow of logic.
** Uses function composition to build composable pieces of logic.
** Uses immutable data, creates new structures from old ones.

* Examples
Here is a password checking function, which checks if a password has at least 9 characters.

function coundGoodPasswords(passwords) {
    const goodPasswords = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < passwords.length; i++) {
        const password = passwords[i];
        if (password.length < 9) {
            continue;
        }
        goodPasswords.push(password);
    }
    return goodPasswords.length;
}
