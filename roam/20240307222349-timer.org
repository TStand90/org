Timers do not start automatically. You need to call their ~start()~ method.

* Wait time
=Wait time= describes the timer's duration. It can be adjusted in the inspector.

* Run once
Timers run in an infinite cycle by defalut. To make a timer run only once, check the =One Shot= option in the inspector.
