#+title: Reading List

A list of books and articles that I'd like to read at some point.

  Marking this one done for now. There are still two more exercise chapters left (chapters 12 & 13).

  Maybe I'll come back and do them later. Maybe not.

  Honestly, I can't stand to work with [[id:bb077623-5540-4767-b6d9-ae4301af5ef2][React]] any longer than I have to.
