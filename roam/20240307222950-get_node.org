A function in [[id:36100b50-2583-454a-85a0-7a8a86cd08a7][Godot]] to get a node from within another node.

A node can be retrieved by providing the full path to ~get_node~.

If a node is a direct child of the node you are currently working in, you can just use the node's name. Example: If there is a child =Timer= class, just use ~get_node("Timer")~.
