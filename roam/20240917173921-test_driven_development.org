#+title: Test-Driven Development

Test-Driven Development, or TDD, is a technique that many swear by, but nobody actually does.

Here are the steps:
1. Write a failing test case (for something that does not yet exist).
2. Get it to compile.
3. Make the test pass.
4. Remove duplication and refactor.
5. Repeat.

For existing, legacy code bases, you can adapt TDD like this:
0. /Get the class you want to change under test/.
1. Write a failing test case.
2. Get it to compile.
3. Make the test pass (try not to change existing code as you do this).
4. Remove duplication and refactor.
5. Repeat.
