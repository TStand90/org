#+title: Vector2

A class in [[id:36100b50-2583-454a-85a0-7a8a86cd08a7][Godot]] that describes a position in a 2D plane, using ~x~ and ~y~ coordinates.

* Methods
** angle()
Describes the angle in radians of the current Vector2.
** normalized()
Returns the Vector2 divided by its length, which limits the length to 1. Useful for ensuring that moving diagonally does not "speed up" the moving character.
