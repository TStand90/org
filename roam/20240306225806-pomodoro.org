#+title: Pomodoro

The Pomodoro technique is a way of splitting up work into around 25 minute segments of working, with a 5-10 minute break in between. A "Pomodoro" refers to the work time interval.

According to Wikipedia, the original technique consists of these steps:
1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the Pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).[1]
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).[4]
5. Go back to Step 2 and repeat until you complete four pomodoros.
6. After four pomodoros are done, take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes) instead of a short break. Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
