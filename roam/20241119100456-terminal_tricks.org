#+title: Terminal Tricks

* Background and foreground tasks
Use =ctrl + z= to run a task in the background. Use =fg= to bring it back.

* Get current IP address
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
curl ifconfig.me
#+END_SRC

* History
Use ~history~ to view previous commands. You can use ~!<number>~ to re-run a given command that is displayed with ~history~.

* pushd and popd
=pushd= "pushes" a directory onto a stack. =popd= pops the stack.

* Re-run previous command
Use =!!= to re-run the previous command.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
!!
#+END_SRC

* Re-use the previous command arg
You can re-use the previous command's args with =!$=. For example, say you used ~ls~ to look inside a directory, and now you want to ~cd~ into it.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ls Documents
cd !$
#+END_SRC

* Run multiple commands
| input | description                               |
|-------+-------------------------------------------|
| ;     | Run commands sequentially                 |
| &&    | If first command fails, next will not run |
| =||=  | Second command runs only if first fails   |
