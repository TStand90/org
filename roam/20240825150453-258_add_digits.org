#+title: 258. Add Digits

* Description
Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

** Example 1:

Input: num = 38
Output: 2
Explanation: The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

** Example 2:

Input: num = 0
Output: 0


Constraints:

0 <= num <= 231 - 1


** Follow up: Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

* Solution
** Solution with loop
#+BEGIN_SRC python
class Solution:
    def addDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
        while num >= 10:
            total = 0

            for number in [int(x) for x in str(num)]:
                total += number

            num = total

        return num
#+END_SRC

** Digital root solution
