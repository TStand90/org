#+title: Stack

Stacks are a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure. The first item to be put on a stack will be the last one removed.

#+NAME: Stack Operations
| Name | Complexity | Descritpion                                     |
|------+------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| Push | O(1)       | Adds an item to the top of the stack            |
| Pop  | O(1)       | Removes an item from the top of the stack       |
| Peek | O(1)       | Returns the topmost element without popping it. |


* Push
Adds an item to the top of the stack in O(1) time.
* Pop
Removes an item from the top of the stack in O(1) time.
It's a good idea to check if the stack is empty before attempting to pop.
* Peek
Returns the topmost element without popping it in O(1) time.
