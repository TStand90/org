#+title: Monogame Roguelike Ideas

* Message Queue
The message queue should probably use the [[id:8140e038-8424-480c-b6a8-608220c9f337][Observer Pattern]]. Actions should "broadcast" messages, and the Message Queue should be able to receive them without needing to be passed to every action. The Action processing queue might be the thing that sends the message.

* Commands
The game should implement the command pattern.

* Actions queue
There should be a queue that takes the player, monsters, and world's Actions in order, and executes them along with their animations. This is so that actions can be "grouped" together, so that certain animations and sound effects can be played in unison.

* Sound
Might want to use the [[id:2807e592-fd35-4551-bb15-fec7cd854666][Service Locator]] pattern for this.
