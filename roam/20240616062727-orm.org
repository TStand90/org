#+title: ORM

ORM stands for "Object Relational Mapper". It's a tool for web developers to avoid learning SQL.

ORMs have several pros and cons.

Pros:
- Easier to work with
- Faster to get an application up and running
- Saves writing a lot of boilerplate youself

Cons:
- Abstracts away the database itself, so you don't know what's going on under the hood
- The abstractions aren't free, so it's slower
- N+1 problems are common
