#+title: Unit Test

In the book [[id:42a0e03e-ed8b-4922-96c0-d60ffed1f7b1][Working Effectively with Legacy Code]], author Michael C. Feathers describes unit tests as such:
1. They run fast.
2. They help us localize problems.

A unit test that takes 1/10th of a second is _not fast_. This is because if you have 30,000 unit tests in a codebase, it will take nearly an hour to run.

Running fast is important, as you want to be able to run your entire unit test suite quickly (ideally 10 minutes or less).

He also says that a test is *not* a unit test if:
1. It talks to a database.
2. It communicates across a network.
3. It touches the file system.
4. You have to do special things to your environment (such as editing configuration files) for it to run.

Such tests are useful, but they are not [[id:341e261f-8bf0-4518-ad78-73d0f4b4b399][Unit Test]]s.
