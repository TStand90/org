I got the title bump I wanted at work. The raise they gave me was not huge - $7000, which brings me from $140,000 to $147,000 per year. Amanda, my manager, told me privately that I got the largest raise on the development team (as a percentage of income, anyway). A bit worrying, as that's not a fantastic raise by any means. I know the company wants to cut costs any way they can, but I do wonder if this will cause people to leave.

As for me, I'll continue to study data structures & algorithms, as well as work on side projects, to try for some "big tech" interviews. I still need to try for those, as the boost to salary and career prospects would be great for me and my family.

Pooja has done great this week watching the kids. Now I need to focus more at work to do my part. I still have a terrible habit of being distracted by my phone while working. I also spent far too much time editing my Vim & Emacs configs today rather than actually working. I want to try using one or the other for work, but it needs to not come at the cost of actual productivity.

I am happy to finally have the "Senior" title at work. It's long overdue in my opinion, but it feels good to be recognized as someone who knows what I'm doing. It's now time to reach for even greater heights, at work and beyond.
