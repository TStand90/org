This is my first journal entry. I'm not sure how often I will write here, or *what* I will write, but I probably should write here.

I am currently in my second week of paternity leave. I'm taking six weeks total. I took two weeks when Marcus was born. I'm hoping to bond with both my children during this time, as well as take some time for myself to become a better software developer. I also want to try my hand at cooking a few new dishes, since I think I'll be doing more cooking around the house from here on out.

It's been four days since I got a vasectomy. I was in more pain than usual this afternoon. I think I overdid it a bit, as I tried picking up both my children today, which I shouldn't be doing. Need to take it easy, so that I'm fully recovered faster.

I read several chapters of the book "ASP.NET Core in Action, 3rd Edition" today. I hope that by learning more about ASP.NET Core, I can broaden my horizons, both in terms of job opportunities, and my knowledge of backend web development in general.

I didn't play any video games today. Wanting to play some Factorio or Tears of the Kingdom, but I should probably get as much sleep tonight as possible.

I'm not sure how to end a journal entry, except to say that I'm interested in seeing if I stick with journaling or not. I have never earnestly tried it, but between this and trying to take Zettelkasten style notes in Org Roam, I'm hoping to make something of a habit of this.
