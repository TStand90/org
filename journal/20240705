Yesterday was rough. I had a lot of thoughts about how much I've failed over the last ten years.

I've failed to make a good career for myself. Failed to work at Big Tech. Failed to be a good husband and father.

Today I had a massive migraine. It actually started last night as I was trying to go to sleep. Perhaps that's why I was feeling so down.

Still, I do think I could have done much, much better over the years. I often think about how much better my life (and the lives of those I love) would be if only I'd done more.

I need to be able to accept the past. I don't know how I can do that yet. I feel so much regret, so often. I don't know how to move past the fact that I haven't lived up to my potential. It's harder still knowing that even if I try my absolute hardest now, it may not be possible to "catch up".

But perhaps there truly is nothing I /can/ do besides try my best now. Maybe that can be enough. Getting up every day and doing my best.

I feel as if I need some guiding philosophy in my life. I have felt rudderless for some time now, and I believe that I need to rely on the wisdom of others to gain some clarity. I'm thinking of getting some books on [[id:34e1a488-8373-455b-8f8f-a6fcb155e941][Stoicism]]  and [[id:2620a193-dcff-4474-b358-edb2ee034963][Existentialism]]. I don't know a lot about these philosphies outside some surface level knowledge, but it seems to me that I need a way of looking at my life that can give me a sense of purpose. Or at least, help me focus on the purpose I want ("be a good father", "get ahead in my career", "do meaningful things", etc.).
