I need to do a better job of not getting emotional about work. Even if I think others are being irrational or are making a bad choice, I need to be able to separate myself from the situation. At the end of the day, my job is my job, and nothing else.

My job is not who I am.

My job is just a one part of my life.

My job is only part of my life *right now*. It is not as important as things that will outlast it (family, personal ambitions, etc.).

Allowing my job to affect my emotional state to the point where it affects my life outside of work is not something I should be doing.

I must care about my job only enough to get paid, move up (where applicable), and stay employed. Any further emotional investment is couter-productive.
