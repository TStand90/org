** [X] Write a Jira ticket that describes the issue with the DoseSpot Pharmacy Search form. It does not mark the required fields as needed
SCHEDULED: <2024-04-02 Tue>
** [ ] Investigate Emacs Meow mode for Doom Emacs
** [ ] Investigate separating my journal into its own git submodule

  There are things I may write in my org-journal that I *really* don't want on my work laptop. Putting it in its own Git submodule that is separated would solve this problem.
** [ ] Investigate having a separate TODO list for work related tasks.

  Not a high priority right now, as removing work stuff later probably isn't too hard.

  I don't necessarily want to pollute my personal TODOs with work stuff.
